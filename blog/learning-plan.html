      <h1>My Learning Plan</h1> 

      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>

      <p>My main goal would be to land a developer role after Dev Academy. In the long run, I am hoping to find a software developer role where I am able to learn from others around me in order to become a better developer. I am still unsure what area I want to specialise in as I am aware of different front end and back end roles. I am hoping that during my time at Dev Academy I will have a better idea of which direction I want to take my developer career.
      </p>

      <h2>Strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
      
      <p>My strengths when it comes to learning is the enjoyment I get from learning new things. I also think that the feeling I get from solving problems and making things work would be considered a strength. An example of this is when things weren't working on the blog or not knowing where to start, I would take a step back and look at resources online to find out what I am doing wrong or to look for some inspiration. Another strength is my motivation to improve my skills as a developer. 
        When it comes to limitations, I have noticed from my time at university that I am easily distracted and end up leaving my work till the last minute. This was problematic as I would put unneeded pressure on myself by leaving big assignments till the day before they were due and end up falling behind. So far I think I am doing a good job on making sure I get a set amount of work done every day to avoid this issue, but it is something I need to work on in order to make the most of my time at Dev Academy.
        </p>

      <h2>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
      
      <p>The main skill I would like to improve on is time management. I think improving this skill will help me greatly in all aspects of life and help me get into a daily routine. The recommended tools like toggl have definitely helped so far with time management but it is something that I aim to improve over time. In terms of human skills, having worked in team environments since the age of 14 I feel like I am able to work well with others but something that I have noticed recently is that I might see people asking for help with something that I might know the answer to but since I am also unsure if my answer is correct or not I won't say anything. I think improving on this will help others and myself when learning new things.</p>
      
      <h2>Commitments to manage my workload</h2>
      <p>When it comes to managing myself to work productively with others, I will try my best to help others where I can, ask for help or advice when needed and be mindful of others time (this might be making sure to not ask for people's help in the middle of the night if I am stuck on something). 
        Other commitments on managing my workload include making sure I am setting targets on how much work I will be trying to get through each day, using the recommended tools like toggl to help keep myself on track when it comes to time management and making sure I am sleeping enough and eating well. When things are building up and I am starting to get stressed out, my plan is to take some time away from my computer. This could be taking my dog for a walk or going for a drive. Then I will come back refreshed and ready to tackle the problem. 
        </p>

      <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
      <p>I think that when I am in need of help I will first try to search my problem online but if I am still stuck on something after that I will ask my peers and facilitators in discord to avoid spending too much time being stuck on one thing. 
      </p>

      <h2>Description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      <p>I think that the main expectation here would be guidance throughout the course, this could be feedback on things I am doing wrong/things I should improve on and things I am doing well. Also some help when I am stuck.</p>

      <h2>Scheduling information and block out times</h2>
      <p>The only commitments I have at the moment is my kickboxing training Monday, Wednesday and Thursday at 5:30 pm but this isn't an issue as I can skip some sessions if I need to get a lot of work done. I have also left my job so I am able to be fully committed to my learning.
