        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>

        <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
        <p>Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to rewire itself through exercise. It is a benefit to people because it allows us to improve our cognitive abilities or in certain cases recover from brain injuries. <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/">As stated in this article:</a> “unlike computers, our brains are able to receive hardware and software updates that form different pathways according to our experiences.”</p>

        <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h2>
        <p>There are many ways of using the principles of neuroplasticity to help benefit me through my software development journey. This means that I should keep regularly challenging myself by engaging with difficult concepts to help form lasting connections in the brain. Another important skill to develop would be the ability to successfully collaborate with others in a team as this will be valuable throughout my career. </p>
        
        <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Challenging the brain</li>
          <li>Regular exercise</li>
          <li>Sleeping well</li>
          <li>Eating well</li>
          <li>Engaging in social activities</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>

        <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h2>
        <p>Growth mindset is the belief that someone's intelligence and abilities can be improved through hard work and practice. It is relevant to me because there may be times where self doubt creeps in and I might question my own abilities when trying to learn something new that is challenging.</p>

        <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
        <p>I found the provided <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-459099">video</a> surprising when the speaker talked about how growth mindset classrooms helped students that were struggling, improve their grades to the top of their district within one year. </p>

        <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
        <p>By looking at difficult challenges as an opportunity to learn rather than a roadblock. Also by learning from mistakes and practicing self reflection.</p>

        <h2>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h2>
        <p>I think that with these new understandings and how they relate to my learning plan, I will be more open to new challenges and be more resilient when I run into obstacles. Knowing that any concept that I find difficult can be learned through hard work and patience will have a positive effect on my learning plan.</p>
