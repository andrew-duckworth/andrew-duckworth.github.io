        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

        <h2>Blocked on a simple problem</h2>
        <p>One time I was blocked on a simple problem this sprint was when dealing with two arrays during the grade book exercise. This was the first time I had come across this problem and I wasn't sure what to do. I knew that there would be a loop involved but that is where I didnt know what to do next. This is when I used google as a problem solving method to search how to loop through an array within an array and found some examples on stack overflow and advice on the Dev Academy discord channel that helped me solve the problem. At first I felt a bit frustrated but kept looking for solutions. I learned that being able to use other peoples experiences online can help my own learning. Here is how I solved the problem:</p>

          <pre>
            <code>
              for (let i = 0; i &lt; students.length; i++) {
                gradebook[students[i]] = {}
              }
            </code>
          </pre>

        <h2>Elegantly solved a problem</h2>
        <p>The first big problem I had was when I started the SuperFizzBuzz exercise. At first I didn't read the question properly so I was not aware of being able to recall the previous function from the FizzBuzz exercise. Once I re-read the question I had to figure out how to recall the function I already had and turn it into a fizzbuzz array. This is when I made a new index page to play around  with console.log but I was still stuck. Then I remembered about the array.map method from the previous week and googled more about it. I found a way to solve the problem using this method but I didn't really understand how it worked so I asked my friend who is a software engineer to show me an easier to understand way of solving the problem. I read out the question out loud to him which made me realize that I needed to declare a new empty array within the function. Next was to create a loop that started at the first element. After that I used the .push method to push the previous function onto the new array and finally return the new fizzbuzz array. At first it felt good to solve the problem with only a couple lines of code but I also felt I didnâ€™t learn much because of the lack of understanding of the method. Once I got help from my friend and wrote the function with broken down steps, it greatly increased my understanding of what each piece of code did.  I learned that it is a lot easier to solve problems with research but it is more important to fully understand what the code is doing. Here is the examples of the code I used:</p>

          <pre>
            <code>
              function superFizzbuzz(arrayParameter) {
                // return arrayParameter.map((numberParamater) =&gt; fizzbuzz(numberParamater)) ------&gt; This works but not sure how.
                newArray = []
                for (let i = 0; i &lt; arrayParameter.length; i++) {
                  currentelement = arrayParameter[i]
                  newArray.push(fizzbuzz(currentelement))
                }
                return newArray
              }
              
            </code>
          </pre>

        <p>Overall I am pretty confident with most of the problem-solving techniques except for pseudocoding, with pseudocoding I find that I often get confused on where to start especially when I dont fully understand the question and unsure how to break it down. In the future I would like to improve on my pseudocoding as I think it will save me a lot of time when it comes to writing the code and also researching specific parts of big chunks of code. I would also like to improve on asking my peers and coaches for help so that I am not stuck on something for too long.  </p>
