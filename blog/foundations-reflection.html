        <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
        <p>The most important thing that I’ve learned from the core exercises would be the topic of neuroplasticity. I’ve learned that I am able to improve my coding skills through hard work and consistency with learning. This was relevant to me because I used to believe I wasn't smart enough to learn software development in the past. Something else I’ve learned would be the importance of a growth mindset and believing in myself when things are getting difficult in order to overcome obstacles. What I’ve also learned is that it is important to create good learning habits and be self aware of my own weaknesses. </p>

        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>Values, empathy and self-awareness play a big role in both learning and programming. Depending on one's values they may prioritize how they learn differently to someone else. Empathy is important in order to work together well with different people as it allows for a healthier team environment if you are able to understand how someone else is feeling. Self-awareness allows us to better understand our own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to learning and being able to realize when we need to ask for help. </p>

        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>It was a bit surprising the amount of core content there was. Learning about neuroplasticity and growth mindset was also a pleasant surprise since I found those topics pretty interesting. </p>

        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>I think that the most challenging part of core learning was sticking to my learning plan because at times the workload would feel overwhelming but also the things I have learnt from core exercises helped me manage the stress.</p>

        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>Because it is important for students to be competent both technically and emotionally in order to be successful when it comes to developing their careers. Having a good understanding of the core content will be important when it comes to working with others and for personal growth. </p>

        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>I don't believe that the core learning is a waste of time as it is important to be well rounded when it comes to looking for a job but personally I would have liked a bit more programming time to improve on what I’ve learned. </p>
