      <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1> 
        
      <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now. </h2>
      
      <p>In my previous job I was once called in to help resolve an argument between two co-workers. This was difficult since I was also friends with one of the co-workers involved in the argument. The ethical decision I made here was to try and be fair to both workmates despite it being easier to side with the one I was friends with. Even though I had an idea of who was in the wrong and who was right in this situation, I tried to be as unbiased as I could to avoid further conflict and calm the situation down. Reflecting back, I think that I did the right thing in this situation considering this is something management would usually handle. </p>

      <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>

      <p>I was born in Myanmar and moved to New Zealand at the age of 6 with my parents. My parents have taught me the importance of working hard to achieve my goals. As I got older I realized how difficult it must have been for them to leave everyone they knew and move to a different country with a completely different culture. This is where I learned the importance of understanding different cultures and being able to adapt to difficult situations. </p>

      <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>

      <p>I think that my biggest strength is my resilience when things aren't going well. During my teenage years I ran into a lot of health issues which resulted in many months in and out of hospital. Because of these experiences, I have learned to deal with stressful situations and learned to stay resilient through adversity. I think that being resilient will be helpful during my learning journey as I am sure there will be many roadblocks and stressful situations throughout my web development journey.</p>

      <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>

      <p>The biggest limitation when it comes to learning would be time management, while I was at university I often left assignments till the last minute which resulted in unnecessary stress and falling behind. Since I am learning something that is completely new to me I wont be able to make the same mistakes while at Dev Academy. This is also something that I want to improve on during my time here. </p>

      <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>

      <p>During my time at university, I had a management paper where I was the team leader for a group of students based in different countries and had to come up with a business concept proposal. While we were trying to collaborate, we had one team member who stopped coming to team meetings and no longer was contributing. The only thing I tried was to message the person in the group chat to check if he was still a part of the project. Reflecting back I think there was definitely more that I could have done to try and get him back on board like contacting him directly to check if everything was ok outside of the project. </p>
